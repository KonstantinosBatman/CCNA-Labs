# OSPF Lab

This is a practical OSPF lab designed to demonstrate basic OSPF configuration, neighbor formation, and route advertisement across four routers whilst 
also connecting 2 end hosts (PCs) on different networks that are connected through the routers. 
The end goal is for the 2 end hosts to be able to communicate with eachother.
